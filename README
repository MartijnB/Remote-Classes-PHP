Remote Classes for PHP 0.1

Copyright 2010 iCept Media. All rights reserved.

Remote Classes for PHP [RCP] is a library to use classes on a remote server 
in a easy way. The client calls class method and properties on a remote object
using a local wrapper.

== SECURITY ==

- The data send between the client and the host is encrypted with Triple Des.
- A remote class must implement RCP_IRemoteCallable to prevent unintended usage
  of classes.
  
== Requirements ==

- PHP 5.2+ (5.3 tested)
- mcrypt extension
- ucspi-tcp (To use Server example 2)

== Examples ==

Three examples are provided: one client and two server implementations. The first 
server implementation is entirely PHP, whereas the second one uses the ucspi-tcp 
TCP server to provide concurrent connections and a more mature basis.

== Documentation ==

The examples should explain everything. Maybe i write addictional documentation
in the future.

== Limitations ==

The following PHP features are NOT supported:

- references (including objects by reference)
- static methods

== Protocol ==
